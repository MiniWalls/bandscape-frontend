## Introduction

Main goal of this project was to deepen my knowledge in web development technologies and learn new and essential ones. For that reason this front-end app is using React library with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. As learning new skills was important and making the repository better, the project is also using eslint to lint our code and make sure it's following certain standards. Jest and Cypress is used to test the app and make sure new changes don't break old features. 

### Application UI

As mentioned briefly before, the UI for this project is made using mainly Tailwind CSS, since it's not perfect for every style of component, the app also utilizes Headless UI component for more complicately styled components. The following are screenshots showcase how the apps UI looks.
